# hokkaido-syntax theme

Colorful, vibrant, meant to evoke colors that I remember from Japan. The blue of the sky in children's pictures, the blue of the water of the Okhotsk, the green of the borders of tatami mats, the aggressive red of the flag and the softer red of faded advertisements, the pinkish color of cherry blossoms and the ripe pinks of peaches, and the bright yellow-orange of Buddhist robes, matched with a purple you'll sometimes see on the flags at Buddhist temples.
